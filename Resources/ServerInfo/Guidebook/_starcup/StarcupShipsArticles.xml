# Ship's Articles

Welcome! [color=#c5ebeb]starcup[/color] is a Medium Roleplay/No ERP server. Below is a short summary of our goals and values for the station as a whole.

Our goal with this server is to facilitate fun, interesting, rewarding social interactions. The goal of these interactions is to build a compelling shared narrative.

“Gameplay” and “roleplay” are not opposed forces. They are closely-entwined tools for achieving the above goals. When in doubt, ask yourself: Am I promoting interesting interactions? Am I contributing to a shared narrative? Fun roleplay and fun gameplay are both sparked by high-quality conflict.

Good conflict requires trust between players, which in turn requires a community-wide standard of kindness, sincerity, inclusivity, and good faith. Decisive moderation will at times be necessary to remove bad actors, but a safe, welcoming community can only thrive if the community itself acts to keep it that way.

Trust and cooperation are most important of all between moderation and the playerbase. Moderation must be consistent, transparent, and fully accountable for its actions to earn this trust.

We trust our players to work in good faith towards these ideals. If an admin reaches out (what's called "bwoinking"), that's us trying to work with you to help achieve them. It's less a reprimand and more us wanting to figure out what your game plan is and how we can help. Likewise, reach out to us if you have any questions or ideas you want to try on a shift!
